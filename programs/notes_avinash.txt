slide 1 


good morning everyone 
today i ll be presenting about my project active directory and domain services 

slide 2

points which i will be covering are overview of adds 
adds physical and logical components

slide 3

the overview of adds  contains authentication authorization and deploying adds 
it also contains centralized network management 
and all the requirements  for installing adds 

slide 4

authentication is basically when we need to verify ourselves using user credentials 
so that network authentication grants access to the resources and we can logon to a computer 


slide 5 

authorization is basically  verifying that  user has permissions to perform certain actions 
for example when account is created SID is created 
when accounts are issued security tokens they also include SIDs and group SIDs 
the token is compared to the dacl 

slide 6

we should deploy adds in office environment because it provides centralized system fro managing everything on a network 
it provides features like centralized directory 
there is integated security  and scalability is provided

slide 7 

centralized network management provides single location for managing users 
resources are shared from a single location 
adds enabled applications have directory service 
we can also apply policies to all the users and computers 
we have group policies fr managing a specific number of users 


slide 8 

these are the requirements fro installing adds 
we need tcp ip  the credentials and the dns name to begin with 

slide 9 



these are the physical components of adds 


slide 10 

so first the domain controller is a server  installed with adds roles and has been promoted to a domain controller
it provides authorization and authentication 
it replicates the updates to other domain controllers in the domain and forest 
it allows admin access to the user accounts and network resources 


slide 11 

the global catalog contains a copy of all adds objects in a forest 
it improves the efficiency to object searches 
that are required for users to logon 


slide 12 

the adds data store has all the database files and manages directory information for users and services 
it contains ntds.dit file 
it is stored inside the ntds folder on all domain controllers 
and it can only accessed by domain contoller processes


slide 13

th adds replication is basically  a topology that is created automatically when a new domain controller is added 
it ensures that all domain controllers have same information 
and it can be managed   by creating addds sites 

slide 14

these are the location components from adds 

slide 15 

the adds schema ensures and defines what objects  can be created in the  directory 
and information that can be attached to an object 


slide 16 

domains are used to manage groups and manage objects in an organization 
it is basically a boundry for applying policies to group of objects or users
it also provides replication to th policies 
it  also provides boundry that is a way to limit the scope of access to the resources 

slide 17 


tree is basically a heirarchy of domanis in adds 
they share a contigous namespace  with the parent domain 
they can have child names 
and by default the create a two-way transitive trust with other domains


slide 18 

these are all the adds objects 
...


slide 19 


the practical 


slide 20 

thank you
